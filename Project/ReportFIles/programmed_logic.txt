Resource utilization:

Our design is heavy on memory and light on logic. We use 434 out of 9112 slice lookup tables, which is only 4%. 

We use 485 LUT-flip-flop pairs, of which 178 have an unused flip-flop. Thus, we use 307 out of 18,224 flip-flops, which is only 1%.

We use 23 out of 232 IO buffers, which is 9%.

We use 30 out of 32 block RAM components. Since the block RAM was the limiting factor in our design, we set out to use as much of the available RAM as possible, and to distribute this storage between the reverberator and looper in an optimal way. We ended up having more block RAM to work with than we were expecting, so we also increased the sample rate in order to increase the sound quality.

Critical timing path:
The critical timing path for the main clock has a delay of 6.260ns. This is the path that any entry of the reverberator's register file takes to reach the looper's register file (when both components are enabled). It passes through a multiplexer, a sign extender, an adder, a comparator and two more multiplexers before finally arriving at the looper's register file.
